 This repository holds files associated with the Peer-graded Assignment #1
 from the "Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments"
 offered on Coursera.

 The files in this project performs statistical analytics on a dataset.

 More specifically, it analyzes an array of unsigned data char items and and reports
 analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the dataset while reordering
 it from large to small.  All statistics are rounded to the nearest integer.

 After analysis and sorting is done, data is printed to the screen.
